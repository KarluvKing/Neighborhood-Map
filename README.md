# Neighborhood-Map
I will develop a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit. I will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

To check the Java Script code used, we can find it in: 

\js\app.js
